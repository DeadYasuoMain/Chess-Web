<p>Chess, as we know it today, has a history spanning over 1500 years, originating in India during the 6th century with a game called Chaturanga. This game then spread to Persia, where it evolved into Shatranj, and eventually, through various cultural exchanges, made its way to the Muslim world and then to Europe. The modern rules of chess, including the moves of the pieces, were largely finalized in Europe by the 15th century.
